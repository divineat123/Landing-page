# Landing Page Project

## Design Choices Made

### 1. HTML Structure
- I divided the page into **three main sections**: Header, Product Section, and Footer.  
- The **Header** includes a navigation bar with links to different sections for easy navigation.  
- The **Product Section** contains four product cards, each with an image, product name, description, and a "Shop Now" button.  
- The **Footer** provides simple contact information and site details.

### 2. CSS Styling
- I used **Bootstrap** to quickly achieve a clean, modern, and responsive layout.  
- Additional custom CSS was applied to improve spacing, font styling, and hover effects for buttons and cards.  
- Chose a simple and professional **color palette** to keep the design minimal and user-friendly.

### 3. Responsiveness
- The layout is **mobile-first**, and Bootstrapâ€™s grid system was used to ensure the page adapts across different screen sizes.  
- I also included **media queries** to fine-tune font sizes and spacing on smaller screens.  
- The navigation bar collapses into a mobile-friendly menu on smaller devices.

### 4. Product Cards
- Each card includes:  
  - Product image  
  - Product name  
  - Short description  
  - Call-to-action **"Shop Now" button** styled with Bootstrap.  
- Hover effects were added to highlight interactivity.

### 5. Additional Features
- Used **Bootstrap Navbar** for responsive navigation.  
- Added **Bootstrap Cards** for consistent styling of products.  
- Buttons are styled with Bootstrap for consistency and improved user experience.  
- Overall, Bootstrap components helped speed up the development process while keeping the design professional.
